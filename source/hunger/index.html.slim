| The first annual Sting Hunger Now Meal-Packaging Event will be held on the campus of the Georgia
| Institute of Technology on March 8, 2013 as part of Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, though
| the event is being sponsored by a variety of clubs and organizations on campus in an effort to unite
| campus through a global-scope volunteering event. Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week is
| the annual week hosted by Georgia Tech’s Mobilizing Opportunities for Volunteer Experience (MOVE)
| club, which organizes service opportunities for students, faculty, and staff on campus. Hunger and
| Homelessness Awareness Week is an opportunity to recruit the next generation of volunteers while
| promoting knowledge of the issues of hunger and homelessness in our communities, both on a local
| and global scale. The Sting Hunger Now Meal-Packaging Event, in a partnership with Stop Hunger Now
| International Hunger Relief, is the culminating event of the week, inviting any and all persons on campus
| to participate in packaging 100,000 meals for children and families in developing countries and crisis
| situations.
